<h3>Mason CC Seeking CCDC Teammates</h3>
<p>
    Mason Competitive Cyber is fielding this year's Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition team for George Mason University. However, given how high profile of an opportunity CCDC is, we're opening this to the university to the best of our ability, extending it beyond just active CC members.
</p>
<h3>Event</h3>
<p>
    Mason CC is proud to host <b>tryouts</b> from noon to 3pm in JC Room F, judged by president and co-president Michael Bailey and Paul Benoit, both of which did well in 2016 Mid-Atlantic CCDC Virtuals (the first round of three). Attendees are welcome to enter and go as they see fit. <b>This is a casual event.</b> We hope to answer any questions about MACCDC, eat some food, and try to get people to demonstrate their abilities so we can best determine who would be best fit to represent George Mason University at that national level in this IT Defense competition.
</p>
<h3>
    Prior History
</h3>
<p>
    George Mason University has participated in CCDC in the highly competitive "Mid-Atlantic" region to limited success in years prior. To participate, generally members had to either be highly qualified or a part of a certain IT course. Our hope is to take this event in the opposite direction and make it as open and fair to the university as possible.
</p>
<h3>Event Expectations</h3>
<p>
    Attendees are expected to have VMware of some sort on their machine, whether it be Workstation, Workstation Player or Fusion. Volgenau students should be able to access free VMware products via their <a href="https://labs.vse.gmu.edu/index.php/FAQ/VMWare">OnTheHub portal</a> as well as a system ready to accept a virtual machine (no major malfunctions, USB ports, ample disk space, etc). Any issues regarding this will be worked out to the best of our ability, but delay that attendee's tryouts. On the day of the event, we will distribute, whether it be via AirDrop or USB (too large for WiFi), virtual images of the attendee's choice (Windows or Linux). They will be "bridged" onto a private wireless network authorized for and run by Mason CC, and attacked by a red team, similar to what one would experience in CCDC. <b>Hack backs are not permitted</b> and it's fine if a virtual machine is compromised, but how one responds is the important part. This scenario will be qualitative rather than quantitative. This means attendees will be evaluated on overall quality of teammate rather than any specific checkboxes as to the actions they took. Do not treat organizers as hostile if they happen to be red teamers. <b>Social engineering or shoulder surfing will not be taken into consideration and will not influence offensive actions.</b>

<h3>Food</h3>

    Food will be on-site as supplies last.
