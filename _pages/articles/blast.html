title: Blast from the Past: ECHO Helps Mason CC Years Later
description: "Founded in 2010, ECHO was created to provide understanding of computer network infrastructure and computer architecture, and since turned into Patriot Hackers. Years later, Mason CC is proud to acquire ECHO's gear."

<h2>Mason CC gets ECHO's gear</h2>
<p>
When's the last time you've had to use an old KVM switch? As it turns out, ECHO had a drawer in the bowls of the Volgenau School of Engineering that was due to be surrendered to the student organizations in VSE and included that as well. Before VSE gave the materials at will to anyone, Mason CC got in contact with Bryan Hoyle, the past president of Patriot Hackers and webmaster of ECHO*.
<br />
In this pillage, we were able to take:
<br />
<ul>
    <li>2 ATEN KVMP switches</li>
    <li>1 Magnetic Strip Treader</li>
    <li>1 Stick Dell 2GB pc2-6400u RAM</li>
    <li>1 Linksys WRT300N (previously used for wargaming) Router</li>
    <li>1 Obscure "Dawn Remembers"/"Too Far" book/CD set that apparently came from a stranger on campus in 2013, an apparent ECHO inside joke</li>
    <li>1 External USB Dell Mouse (cheaper desktop grade)</li>
    <li>3 Dell Ox398D ATI Radeon HD3450 Standard Profile 256MB DVI PCI-E Graphics Card</li>
    <li>3 Ethernet Cables</li>
    <li>Approx. 7 VGA to KVM port* cables</li>
    <li>2 13V AC Adapters</li>
</ul>
With an approximate cumulative retail value in excess of $500. We already have plans for a good sum of it, including whoever is going to be able to break into the router tonight at our first Fall meeting.

<h3>About ECHO</h3>
<p>
    An older organization, as far as this group can tell they were last active in early 2014 and started in 2010. <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/org/echo/about.html">Funny enough, their site is still available</a> and can probably tell you more than we can about ECHO. ECHO largely evolved into Patriot Hackers, which became inactive in the Fall of last year and officially deregistered this Fall.
