    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        patriotCTF was an event that saw a variety of students interested in cybersecurity face off on at least 30
        cybersecurity problems.
    </p>
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
    <p>
        Attendance was originally a major concern of ours as we only accepted about 75 people and had food and
        infrastructure of 70. Attendees pulled through, however, with an attendance between 70-80. Supplemental food was
        ordered on-site to accomodate overflow. Competitors were from GMU, UMD, UMBC, UVA, RIT, Montgomery, NVCC and
        more. Additionally, points of contact from Mason CC's friendly neighborhood event and organization sponsor <a
            href="https://www.battelle.org/">Battelle</a> were nice enough to drop by and help. Chris "CJ" Gardner also
        dropped by, an ex-UMBC competitor and friend of the regional CTF community.
        <br /><br />

    <h3>Results</h3>

        <br />
        UMD took an early lead, maintaining it for the entirety of the competition. <i>Age of Null</i> is a highly
        competitive team and had no mercy whatsover, refusing to even buy hints. Their challenge solves were very evenly
        distributed.
        <br /><br />
        Taking second was UVA's <i>HTCPCP://</i>, who took a relatively opposite strategy, battling in the thick of it
        with other teams and ultimately taking advantage of the hints, immediately leading to key captures.
        <br /><br />
        Third was <i>72PointComicSans</i> who seemed to have issues closing out key problems, such as sitting on almost
        working (possibly fully working) exploit code for a 300 point problem effectively accepting defeat. A relatively
        last minute push caused a capture or two that pushed them firmly into third.
        <br /><br />
        Fourth was pure controversy. GMU's Early to the Party scored at 4:58 with the closure of the competition at 5,
        and UMD_CSEC_Leftovers scored at 5:00:01 putting them back over. Ultimately, in a unanimous challenge team vote,
        the organizing body decided to allow the final point, giving fourth to UMD's <i>UMD_CSEC_Leftovers</i>.

    </p>
    <h3>Operations</h3>
    <p>
        Virginia Cyber Range was nice enough to host the challenges, with Battelle providing prizes, George Mason
        University's Student Funding Board paying for most of the food (pizza was purchased by Mason CC) and Mason CC
        itself paying for the challenge server.
