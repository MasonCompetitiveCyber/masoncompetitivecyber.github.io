<b>This is a supplement to our Getting Started doc available <a href="https://go.gmu.edu/ccbeginners">here.</a></b>

<h3>No Formal Requirements</h3>
<p>We do not have a formal list as to who is and isn't a member. <a href="https://getconnected.gmu.edu/organization/masoncc">GetConnected requests</a> to join our university roster are automatically accepted. We ask that we have some record of your participation, whether that's a presence in our Slack or a competition attendance or something else, before you list you are a CC member on your resume or elsewhere. Otherwise we will not verify this.
</p>
<h3>Competing</h3>
<p>Competitions are open to all but generally require you join our Slack so we can coordinate and communicate. If we don't want you to compete in a particular event but you somehow signed up, we will let you know in direct messages the event may not be appropriate for you. You do not have to worry about that. Registration occurs in Slack, starting in particular the <i>#ctf-watch</i> channel. All competitions generally break off into new channels from ctf-watch to new event channels, for instance <i>#umdctf</i> for UMDCTF, which are announced in ctf-watch along with event details. Carpooling, event details including context we may have on the challenges and related social functions (restaurants/bars are common) are then organized in that channel. If there are mulitple teams from CC competing against each other, they may break off from that to private channels. If there is only one, the competition is generally discussed live in that channel. We have an archive of public Slack communications available per request that includes public competition channels.

<h3>Social</h3>
<p>People regularly communicate at meetings, as well as in Slack above. CC has regular socials, including a WarGames screening, DefCon video potluck, and more. CC also goes out for dinner (or whatever is applicable, if we're in a hotel for a multi-day event we'll obviously do more) generally after a competition for those who competed. Social engagement is something we are always looking to further develop, with plans to do a fundraiser at Panera or Manhattan Pizza.</p>


<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>In addition to resources passed in Slack, we encourage you to attend our meetings <a href="https://competitivecyber.club/meeting/">enumerated here.</a> We encourage you to check out whatever topic you find most interesting if there are multiple. There is also a document <a href="https://go.gmu.edu/ccbeginners">on getting started</a> that includes educational resources.
