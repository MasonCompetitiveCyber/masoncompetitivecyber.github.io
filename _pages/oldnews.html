            <h3>Mason CC Shirts Delivered</h3>

            <p>Mason CC has officially delivered their shirts. Some are coming to meetings, but it's recommended to reach out to an executive member in advance to confirm your size will be made available if you are an eligible member.  GRIMM shirts are expected in the week of February 26th for the few members that qualified for that.<br><br>

                            <p>We are happy to announce we've accepted sponsorship from Battelle to further our education mission and compete in bigger and better ways.

This will be recognized at our November 8th meeting and Battelle will be prominently displayed in most places Mason CC is as a result.</p>

                            <p>Mason CC sent a team to Annapolis for "Crack the Shell", a CTF competition. This was a CTF run on August 12th in the O’Callaghan Annapolis Hotel, with $1000 being the grand prize. Unfortunately we didn't win so we don't have an exact placement but we believe they landed around eighth. Food and drink was provided.
