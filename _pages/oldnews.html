            <p>Mason CC has officially delivered their shirts. Some are coming to meetings, but it's recommended to reach out to an executive member in advance to confirm your size will be made available if you are an eligible member.  GRIMM shirts are expected in the week of February 26th for the few members that qualified for that.<br><br>

This was a CTF run on August 12th in the O’Callaghan Annapolis Hotel, with $1000 being the grand prize. Unfortunately we didn't win so we don't have an exact placement but we believe they landed around eighth. Food and drink was provided.
